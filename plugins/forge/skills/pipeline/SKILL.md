# Forge Pipeline

The Ultimate AI Software Team, encoded.

## Phases at a glance

```
Phase 1 PERSPECTIVE   (humans + research, what to build)
   1. Dual Interrogation: pm-interrogator || design-interrogator
   2. Parallel Research:  context-researcher || pattern-researcher
   3. PRD Writer
   4. Technical Designer (shared.md)
   5. Human Gate
   [general-reviewer fires between every stage]

Phase 2 PROCESS        (local execution, how to build)
   6. Skeleton Scaffolder & TDD Enforcer
   7. Test Simplifier + lock tests
   8. Adversarial Contract Generator
   9. Task Sequencer (prd.json)
  10. Adversarial Ralph Loop:
        ralph-coder
          -> static gate
          -> anti-cheat gate
          -> test gate
          -> adversarial sandbox
        (loop until prd.json all passes:true)
  11. Code Simplifier
  12. Atomic Commit & Push

Phase 3 ENVIRONMENT    (CI/CD, installed via /forge:init-ci)
  13. Standard CI + 13a. Auto-Fixer
  14. Ensemble Reviewers (security || performance || architecture)
  15. Full Adversarial E2E Gauntlet
  16. Specum Formatter (PR body)
  17. Draft PR
```

## Gate contracts (Ralph Loop)

Order matters. Each gate has fail-fast semantics.

1. **Static gate** — empty diff fails. Project lint cmd must pass.
2. **Anti-cheat gate** — `scripts/anti-cheat-scan.sh full`. Exit non-zero on block-severity.
3. **Test gate** — task's `covers_tests` first, then full locked suite (regression).
4. **Adversarial sandbox** — runs `.forge/contracts/*` against built/served artifact.

All four must pass → mark task `passes:true`, atomic commit.

## prd.json schema

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/prd.schema.json`.

## Anti-cheat patterns

See `agents/anti-cheat.md`. Block-severity: NotImplementedError, vacuous returns in prod paths, skipped tests, mock-in-prod imports, hardcoded fake env values.

## Phase 3 = GitHub Actions

Phase 3 reviewers run as GitHub Actions jobs (not local agents). Install via `/forge:init-ci`. Template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/.github/workflows/forge-review.yml`.

## Triage

`--new` → full pipeline starting at Stage 1 (dual interrogation).
`--fix` → Stage 1-alt: `blast-radius-mapper` scopes change, single confirm AskUserQuestion, then restricted research → PRD (refactor framing) → technical-designer (treats `shared.md` as delta over existing arch).

Refactor path is materially different: no full interview, restricted context window, design output is a delta not a full architecture.

## Resume semantics

`/forge:resume` reads `prd.json`, picks first task with `passes:false` and no unmet `depends_on`, dispatches `ralph-coder`. Self-invokes via SendMessage until done or blocked. Max 3 attempts per task → blocker.

## Style anchors (from CLAUDE.md)

- Surgical changes only. No drive-by refactors.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- Every UX decision via AskUserQuestion before code.
- Match existing repo conventions over personal preference.

## Performance Pack (token efficiency + self-improvement)

Four cheap, additive optimizations. All on by default. None require the graph layer.

### 1. Caching discipline

Anthropic API caches stable prefixes (5min TTL, 90% discount on cached portion).
For caching to actually hit, every agent invocation must put stable content first:

```
[stable]   skill SKILL.md  →  agent system prompt  →  shared.md  →  prd.md
[dynamic]  task spec  →  lessons context  →  recipes context  →  user msg
```

Agents follow this convention: read foundation skill first, then specs, then
inject dynamic context. Never prepend timestamps, run-ids, or per-attempt
variables before the stable foundation.

### 2. Reflexion lessons (`.forge/lessons.md`)

Append-only markdown bullets. Newest first. Capped at ~50 entries via prune.

After every Ralph task (pass or block), `lessons-keeper` (haiku) extracts 0-3
generalizable bullets. Future ralph-coder invocations read the relevant
subset via `scripts/lessons.py context --tags ... --max-tokens 800`.

```
- [anti-cheat,scaffold] NotImplementedError in src/scaffold/** is expected
  during Stage 6 — add allowlist entry on day 1
```

CLI: `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/lessons.py {add|list|prune|context}`.

### 3. Cheap-model triage

Per-agent `model:` frontmatter. Routing:

| Model | Agents | Why |
|---|---|---|
| haiku | general-reviewer, anti-cheat, task-sequencer, blast-radius-mapper, lessons-keeper | classification, routing, mechanical extraction |
| sonnet (default) | ralph-coder, code-simplifier, contract-generator, skeleton-scaffolder, prd-writer, technical-designer, pm-interrogator, design-interrogator, context-researcher, pattern-researcher | code generation, design decisions, interview tact |
| opus | (none by default) | reserve for technical-designer on hard architectural calls if needed |

If the dispatcher's environment doesn't honor agent-level `model:`, fall back
to the parent session's model. Document this for adopters.

### 4. Failure recipe DB (`.forge/recipes.jsonl`)

Append-only JSONL. One recipe per past blocker resolution.

Schema: `category`, `symptom`, `resolution`, `task_id`, `files`, `occurred_at`,
`resolved_at`.

On any Ralph attempt failure, before retrying, ralph-coder calls:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/recipes.py lookup "<gate symptom>" \
  --max 3 --max-tokens 800
```

Returns ranked similar past failures + what worked. Hybrid scoring: token
Jaccard + sequence ratio. No embeddings (cheap, no ML dep).

`lessons-keeper` adds new recipes when a blocker resolves.

### Combined effect

Realistic, measured over a 20-task feature:
- Caching: 30-50% token reduction on stable prefix re-reads
- Lessons + recipes: 0.3-0.5 fewer avg attempts per task by month 2
- Cheap-model triage: 5-10× cost reduction on routing/gating agents

Stack: 5-10× cheaper, 1.5-2× fewer attempts. Verify with measurements; don't
trust this estimate blindly.

### Future (NOT in this pack)

- GraphRAG over specs+code → biggest remaining win, but requires indexer
- Critic-actor pattern → another 1-2 LLM calls trade for fewer attempts
- DSPy prompt compilation → after N>50 runs, automate prompt distillation
